# Resume Console

A website built with Flutter to showcase my skills, experience, projects and more.

## Getting Started

To get started, run the `help` command. This will display all of the commands that are available.

The `about` command
- Learn more about me and this website!

The `skills` command
- See what I am good at!

The `projects` command
- See my personal projects that I have been working on in my free time

The `education` command
- See where I learned most of my skills

The `contact` command
- Find out how to get into contact with me

The `clear` command
- Resets all the text in the terminal

## Upcoming Features

If I get the chance to, I plan on adding some simple linux commands, like `echo`, `ifconfig`, and `ping`.

Whenever those commands are added, I may add some file management commands (`touch`, `ls`, `mkdir`, `rm`, `cd`, `pwd`, `cp`, `grep` etc.), that will connect with Firebase storage.

## Known Issues

- URL Launcher is not working correctly. Sometimes opening links works correctly, other times they do not send you to the correct URL."# Resume-Console"
